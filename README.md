# Bowling Challenge in JavaScript

This is a bowling scorecard app written in JavaScript. It is designed to be a single-page app that allows a user to enter the number of pins knocked down per roll and calculates the score for a single player bowling game.

This is an unfinished joint project App with Sidra Iqbal. It was discontinued due to competing time pressures where I felt I had more to gain at the time from tackling other work. I would like to return to this at some point in the future.

## Getting Started
